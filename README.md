# Python, SQL, and Streamlit 
# Domain Personal Finance and Expense Tracking 
 
Problem Statement: 
This project aims to simulate an expense tracker for an individual using the Faker library. The 
project generates realistic monthly expense data, processes and stores it in a SQL database, 
and creates SQL queries to derive insights into spending behavior. A Streamlit app is 
developed to visualize these insights and showcase the results of SQL queries. The tracker 
will highlight expenses across categories like bills, groceries, subscriptions, and personal 
spending, providing a comprehensive overview of financial habits over a year. 
Business Use Cases: 
● Automating the tracking of personal or business expenses from e-commerce 
platforms. 
● Analyzing and categorizing spending habits to create actionable savings plans. 
● Building financial dashboards for tracking income and expenditure 
trends.Providing businesses insights into procurement and inventory 
purchasing patterns. 
Approach: 
● Data Simulation: Use the Faker library to generate a realistic dataset that 
depicts a person’s expense throughout the month.create 12 different tables for 
each month. 
● Database Creation: Create a SQL database schema and load the generated 
dataset for querying. 
● EDA: Analyze the dataset using Python libraries to extract insights about 
spending patterns and trends. 
● Streamlit App: Develop a user-friendly web application showcasing 
visualizations and SQL query outputs. 
● Insights & Recommendations: Provide actionable takeaways based on 
simulated data analysis. 
Questions to be answered:  
Analyze your spending habits by answering the following 15 questions using SQL 
queries and visualizing the results in a Streamlit application. Additionally, formulate 
your own 10-15 insightful queries to further explore your spending patterns. 
1. What is the total amount spent in each category? 
2. What is the total amount spent using each payment mode? 
3. What is the total cashback received across all transactions? 
4. Which are the top 5 most expensive categories in terms of spending? 
5. How much was spent on transportation using different payment modes? 
6.  Which transactions resulted in cashback? 
7. What is the total spending in each month of the year? 
8.  Which months have the highest spending in categories like "Travel," "Entertainment," 
or "Gifts"? 
9. Are there any recurring expenses that occur during specific months of the year (e.g., 
insurance premiums, property taxes)? 
10. How much cashback or rewards were earned in each month? 
11. How has your overall spending changed over time (e.g., increasing, decreasing, 
remaining stable)? 
12. What are the typical costs associated with different types of travel (e.g., flights, 
accommodation, transportation)? 
13. Are there any patterns in grocery spending (e.g., higher spending on weekends, 
increased spending during specific seasons)? 
14.  Define High and Low Priority Categories 
15. Which category contributes the highest percentage of the total spending? 
Results:  
● A functional Streamlit app showcasing visualizations of spending patterns and 
outputs of 15 above mentioned and your own 10-15 SQL queries. 
● Identification of spending trends, such as top categories and monthly 
expenditure breakdown. 
● Data-driven insights into optimizing expenses and managing finances 
effectively.
